        Constructor for DatabaseConnectionMemory.

        If timestamp field name is specified, then database is assumed to be a
        time series database, every datapoint written to the database must
        contain a field with this name, and this will enable various
        time-related methods to access the data (e.g., fetching a time span,
        creating an iterator that returns data points in time order).

        If object ID field name is specified, then database is assumed to be
        contain data associated with objects (e.g., measurement devices), every
        datapoint written to the database must contain a field with this name,
        and this will enable various object methods to access the data (e.g.,
        fetching all data associated with a specific list of object IDs).

        The final argument contains the names of the remaining fields. Any
        subsequent data sent to the database that is not associated with one of
        the field names in these three arguments will be silently rejected.
